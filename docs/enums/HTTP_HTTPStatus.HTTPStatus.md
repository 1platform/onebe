# Enumeration: HTTPStatus

[HTTP/HTTPStatus](../modules/HTTP_HTTPStatus.md).HTTPStatus

A list with the supported HTTP Status codes that can be used
in the application.

Statuses starting with 2 (200, 201, 202, 204 etc.) are usually
sent when you want to show a successful response.

Statuses starting with 4 (400, 401, 403 etc.) are usually sent
when you want to show that the response has failed, based on the
input received from the user.

Statuses starting with 5 (500, 501, 503 etc.) are usually sent
when you or the server want to show that something failed.
